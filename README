1. DESCRIPTION
==============

CocoaFob is a set of helper code snippets for registration code generation and
verification in Objective-C applications, integrated with registration code
generation in Potion Store <http://www.potionfactory.com/potionstore>.

The current implementation uses DSA to generate registration keys, which
significantly reduces chances of crackers producing key generators for your
application. Unfortunately, it also means the registration code can be quite
long.

To make registration codes human-readable, CocoaFob encodes them using a
slightly modified Base32 to avoid ambiguous characters. It also groups codes
in sets of five characters separated by dashes. A sample registration code may
look like this:

GAWQE-FCUGU-7Z5JE-WEVRA-PSGEQ-Y25KX-9ZJQQ-GJTQC-CUAJL-ATBR9-WV887-8KAJM-QK7DT-EZHXJ-CR99C-A

One of the advantages of DSA is that for a given registration name, each
generated code is different, as there is a random element introduced during
the process.

Providing a Registration Source String
--------------------------------------

To register an application that uses CocoaFob, it is necessary to provide a
string of source information, which may be as simple as a registration name
and arbitrarily complex in case your application is processing the included
information in a user-friendly way. For example, as suggested in the sample
implementation of Potion Store licence generator, a source string may contain
application name, user name and number of copies:

decloner|Joe Bloggs|1

When sending registration mail, you need to provide both the source string and
the registration code. Potion Store does this for you. However, small
modifications are needed to make automatic activation work.

Automatic Activation
--------------------

Potion Store supports automatic activation of an installed application by
clicking on a special link in a registration email or on the Thank You store
page. For this to work, you need to:

- make your application support a registration URL scheme;

- modify Potion Store so that automatic activation link contains not only
  registration code, but registration source string as well.

3. GENERATING KEYS
==================

Convert DSA private key from PEM to DER format
----------------------------------------------

openssl dsa -inform PEM -outform DER -in dsapriv512.pem -out dsapriv512.der

Extract public key from private key
-----------------------------------

openssl dsa -in dsapriv512.pem -pubout -out dsapub512.pem

openssl dsa -in dsapriv512.der -pubout -out dsapub512.der -inform DER \
-outform DER
